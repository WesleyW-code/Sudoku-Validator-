A sudoku grid consists of 9×9 = 81 cells split in 9 sub-grids of 3×3 = 9 cells.
For the grid to be correct, each row must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9), each column must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9) and each sub-grid must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9).

i used dataframes in this code as it made the information easy to manipulate.

This code will answer true if the grid is correct or false if it is not.
